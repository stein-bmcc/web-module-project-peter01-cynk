            I am Hein Win Kyaw, a passionate and self-taught 3D Environment Artist currently pursuing an Associate in Science degree in Video Arts and Technology at BMCC, with an impressive GPA of 3.9. My expertise spans Blender, Photoshop, Unreal Engine, and Substance Painter, enabling me to create high-quality 3D environments for games and commercials. 
            I've honed my craft through roles such as Game Environment Artist at Q.O.R.P.O World, where I developed immersive 3D game environments and optimized their performance in Unreal Engine, and as a Freelance Visual Development Artist, delivering visually compelling projects tailored to client needs. My commitment to creative excellence is evident in my collaborative approach, technical proficiency, and ability to deliver on time and within budget.
            Beyond professional work, I’ve contributed as a Camera Operator and Live Stream Setup Technician at New Life Irvine Church, showcasing my adaptability and technical skills in media production. Recognized with achievements like the BMCC Dean’s List and 1st Place at the BMCC Film Festival for Best Fictional (2024), I am dedicated to pushing creative boundaries and bringing captivating visual stories to life.
